## 🚀 Featured Project: The Olist Data Engineering Trilogy
*A comprehensive journey through the data lifecycle, from local exploration to high-scale Cloud infrastructure.*

I have leveraged the **Brazilian E-Commerce (Olist)** dataset to demonstrate my growth across three distinct levels of data maturity:

### [Phase 1: Python & SQL Foundation](https://github.com/ZinelabidineCh/olist-python-sql-foundation)
**Focus:** *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Scripting*
* Built a local ingestion pipeline to transform 9 CSVs into a structured **SQLite** database.
* Conducted deep-dive analysis on customer behavior and delivery lead times using **Pandas** and **SQLAlchemy**.
* **Key Outcome:** Identified the critical correlation between delivery delays and 1-star customer reviews.

### [Phase 2: Business Intelligence & Strategic Dashboards](https://github.com/ZinelabidineCh/olist-bi-powerbi-analytics)
**Focus:** *Data Modeling & Visualization*
* Developed an enterprise-grade **Star Schema** data model in **Power BI**.
* Created advanced **DAX measures** for YoY Growth, AOV, and RFM Customer Segmentation.
* **Key Outcome:** Delivered a dynamic executive dashboard to track $16M in revenue and logistics KPIs.

### [Phase 3: Production Cloud ELT Pipeline](https://github.com/ZinelabidineCh/olist-elt-pipeline-gcp-looker)
**Focus:** *Scalable Data Engineering & Cloud Architecture*
* Engineered a production-ready pipeline on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.
* Automated data transformations with **Dataform (SQLX)** and optimized storage in **BigQuery** using **Partitioning** and **Clustering**.
* **Key Outcome:** Reduced query costs by 90% and enabled real-time reporting via **Looker Studio**.
